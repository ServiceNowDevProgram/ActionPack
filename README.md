# ActionPack: An action-packed pack of Flow Actions!

Welcome to ServiceNow's ActionPack community repository, managed by the Developer Program and the sndevs Slack community.

> Interested in our other ServiceNow Hacktoberfest projects? See the main repository [here](https://github.com/ServiceNowDevProgram/Hacktoberfest) or see our official blog post [here](https://devlink.sn/hacktoberfest).

### Have you ever looked for an action in Workflow Studio, only to find that an appropriate utility or action is missing? 

ActionPack is designed to address this problem by crowdsourcing action definitions across the ServiceNow community that can be used by developers! It is built on the principle of "Many hands make light work", and is available for download and use in any ServiceNow instance.

> [!NOTE]
> In order to make all step types available, we recommend installing the ServiceNow IntegrationHub Enterprise Pack Installer plugin. The different installers are documented [here](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/bundle/zurich-integrate-applications/page/administer/integrationhub/reference/ih-plugins.html).
>
> The location these are installed depends on whether you are on a customer/vendor instance, or a PDI:
> - **Customer/Vendor**: Install the plugin from Now Support using the Automation Store: [ServiceNow IntegrationHub Enterprise Pack Installer](https://support.servicenow.com/now/en/pages/automation-store?id=ns_automation_store&plugin_sys_id=752e0d351b2d90101c8633f2cd4bcbc4) 
> - **PDI**: Install the plugin from the Developer site using the Manage Instance page: [Manage Instance](https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/manage-instance)
